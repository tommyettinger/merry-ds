/**
 * An unordered map where the keys are objects. This implementation uses Robin Hood Hashing with the backward-shift
 * algorithm for removal, and finds space for keys using Fibonacci hashing instead of the more-common power-of-two mask.
 * Null keys are not allowed. Null values are allowed. No allocation is done except when growing the table size.
 * <br>
 * See <a href="https://codecapsule.com/2013/11/11/robin-hood-hashing/">Emmanuel Goossaert's blog post</a> for more
 * information on Robin Hood hashing. It isn't state-of-the art in C++ or Rust any more, but newer techniques like Swiss
 * Tables aren't applicable to the JVM anyway, and Robin Hood hashing works well here.
 * <br>
 * See <a href="https://probablydance.com/2018/06/16/fibonacci-hashing-the-optimization-that-the-world-forgot-or-a-better-alternative-to-integer-modulo/">Malte Skarupke's blog post</a>
 * for more information on Fibonacci hashing. In the specific case of this data structure, Fibonacci hashing improves
 * protection against what are normally very bad hashCode() implementations. Generally speaking, most automatically
 * generated hashCode() implementations range from mediocre to very bad, and because library data structures can't
 * expect every hashCode() to be high-quality, it is the responsibility of the data structure to have some measure of
 * safeguard in case of frequent collisions. The JDK's HashMap class has a complex set of conditions to change how it
 * operates to counteract malicious insertions performed to deny service; this works very well unless the hashCode()
 * of keys is intentionally broken. This class uses a simpler approach. Some main approaches to using hash codes to
 * place keys in an array include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Prime Modulus: use a prime number for array capacity, and use modulus to wrap hashCode() into the table size</li>
 *     <li>Bitmask: use a power of two for array capacity, and get only the least significant bits of a hashCode() up
 *         until the area used is equal to capacity.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The first approach is robust, but quite slow due to modulus being needed sometimes several times per operation, and
 * modulus is one of the slowest numerical operations on ints. The second approach is widespread among fast hash
 * tables, but either requires the least significant bits to be varied between hashCode() results (the most significant
 * bits usually don't matter much), or for collisions to have some kind of extra position to place keys. The first
 * requirement is a no-go with most automatically generated hashCode()s; if a field is a float, they have to convert it
 * to a usable int via {@link Float#floatToRawIntBits(float)}, and in many cases only the most significant bits will
 * change between the results of those calls. The second is usually done by probing, where another position in the
 * array is checked to see if it's available, then another and so on until an available space is found. The second
 * requirement can also sometimes be achieved with a "stash," which stores a list of problematic keys next to the rest
 * of the keys, but if the stash gets too large, most operations on the set or map get very slow, and if the stash size
 * depends on the key array's size, then too many items going in the stash can force massive memory use. ObjectSet and
 * ObjectMap in libGDX have this last problem, and can run out of memory if their keys have poor hashCode()s.
 * <br>
 * This class does things differently, though it also uses a power of two for array capacity. Fibonacci hashing
 * takes a key's hashCode(), multiplies it by a specific long constant, and bitwise-shifts just enough of the most
 * significant bits of that multiplication down to the least significant area, where they are used as an index into the
 * key array. The constant has to be ((2 to the 64) divided by the golden ratio) to work effectively here, due to
 * properties of the golden ratio, and multiplying by that makes all of the bits of a 32-bit hashCode() contribute some
 * chance of changing the upper 32 bits of the multiplied product. What this means in practice, is that inserting
 * Vector2 items with just two float values (and mostly the upper bits changing in the hashCode()) goes from 11,279
 * items per second with the above Bitmask method to 2,594,801 items per second with Fibonacci hashing, <b>a 230x
 * speedup</b>. With some specific ranges of Vector2, you can crash ObjectSet with an OutOfMemoryError by inserting as
 * little as 7,040 Vector2 items, so this is a significant improvement!
 * <br>
 * In addition to Fibonacci hashing to figure out initial placement in the key array, this uses Robin Hood hashing to
 * mitigate problems from collisions. The ObjectMap and ObjectSet classes in libGDX use Cuckoo hashing with a stash, but
 * no probing at all. This implementation probes often (though Fibonacci hashing helps) and uses linear probing (which
 * just probes the next item in the array sequentially until it finds an empty space), but can swap the locations of
 * keys. The idea here is that if a key requires particularly lengthy probes while you insert it, and it probes past a
 * key that has a lower probe length, it swaps their positions to reduce the maximum probe length (which helps other
 * operations too). This swapping behavior acts like "stealing from the rich" (keys with low probe lengths) to "give to
 * the poor" (keys with unusually long probe lengths), hence the Robin Hood title.
 * <br>
 * The name "Merry" was picked because Robin Hood has a band of Merry Men, "Merry" is faster to type than "RobinHood"
 * and this was written around Christmas time.
 * <br>
 * This set performs very fast contains and remove (typically O(1), worst case O(log(n))). Add may be a bit slower, depending on
 * hash collisions. Load factors greater than 0.91 greatly increase the chances the set will have to rehash to the next higher POT
 * size.
 * <br>
 * Iteration can be very slow for a set with a large capacity. {@link #clear(int)} and {@link #shrink(int)} can be used to reduce
 * the capacity. {@link OrderedMap} provides much faster iteration.
 * <br>
 * The <a href="http://codecapsule.com/2013/11/17/robin-hood-hashing-backward-shift-deletion/">backward-shift algorithm</a>
 * used during removal apparently is key to the good performance of this implementation. Thanks to Maksym Stepanenko,
 * who wrote a similar class that provided valuable insight into how Robin Hood hashing works in Java:
 * <a href="https://github.com/mstepan/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/max/algs/hashing/robin_hood/RobinHoodHashMap.java">Maksym's code is here</a>.
